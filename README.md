# Experimenting with Rust

This is my first stab at creating something using Rust.  As such, this is not so much about writing perfect, idiomatic code - but more about actually writing something and seeing what is easy to do and what is not.

Rather than do something too boring, I thought I'd have a go at a small game in the terminal.  I don't usually write games, so I'm sure the approach I use could be much improved!  I'm also not using an existing game engine, as that is not what this is all about.
